What is a fractal? 



Imagine the tree. 



Imagine you are climbing the tree. At twice your height above the ground, the tree forks, and you have to choose a path. 



As you climb, you run into another fork. And you have to pick another path. 



Eventually, you reach the point where are you are too heavy, and the branches are too skinny, so you have to climb down again. 



But as you were climbing the tree, you learned that trees are made of forks, and every time the tree branch split a fork you had to choose you're different way to go.
 



Climb back down out of the tree. 



Now imagine you went back up the tree. You are back at the fork, the first fork.  With a mighty yank, you break one of the branches off at that first fork. You practically take half the tree down with you. 



Dragging that big old tree branch behind you, you go little ways away from the original tree, dig a hole, and stick that branch but first in the hole. So now the whole tree branch is standing upright in the hole. 



Stand back and admire your work.

This branch that you have ‘planted’ now looks like a smaller copy of the original tree. 



Of course, this tree doesn't have roots, so all of its leaves were with her and die in pretty short order. But for now it looks like the original tree except as a smaller version. 



Now you can go up to this mini tree number two, and travel up it's trunk a little bit. Until you get to the fork in the trunk. Tear a branch off this tree, and drag it a little bit away. 



Plant this branch upright in the ground, and hey, it looks like an even smaller copy of the original tree!
