What is a fractal? 



Imagine the tree. 



Imagine you are climbing the tree. At twice your height above the ground, the tree forks, and you have to choose a path. 



As you climb, you run into another fork. And you have to pick another path. 



Eventually, you reach the point where are you are too heavy, and the branches are too skinny, so you have to climb down again.
