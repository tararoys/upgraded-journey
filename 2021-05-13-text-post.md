What is a fractal? 



Imagine the tree. 



Imagine you are climbing the tree. At twice your height above the ground, the tree forks, and you have to choose a path. 



As you climb, you run into another fork. And you have to pick another path. 



Eventually, you reach the point where are you are too heavy, and the branches are too skinny, so you have to climb down again. 



But as you were climbing the tree, you learned that trees are made of forks, and every time the tree branch split a fork you had to choose you're different way to go.
 



Climb back down out of the tree. 



Now imagine you went back up the tree. You are back at the fork, the first fork.  With a mighty yank, you break one of the branches off at that first fork. You practically take half the tree down with you.
