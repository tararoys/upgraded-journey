Fellow creatures have also gotten up, and three of the four farm cats, including both black ones and the short haired black and white one, have already started their full schedule of lounging on the front deck in the sunshine. The temperature is hovering around 70Â°F, the dew has burnt off, birds are tweeting, and it is a gorgeous day to be up and about.](14_May_2021_07_46_37.jpg)



Junior, Black beauty, and midnight are sitting on the deck enjoying the sunshine.
