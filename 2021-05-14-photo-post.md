Fellow creatures have also gotten up, and three of the four farm cats, including both black ones and the short haired black and white one, have already started their full schedule of lounging on the front deck in the sunshine. The temperature is hovering around 70Â°F, the dew has burnt off, birds are tweeting, and it is a gorgeous day to be up and about.](14_May_2021_07_46_37.jpg)



Junior, Black beauty, and midnight are sitting on the deck enjoying the sunshine. 



 

![I could hurry sure my morning chores, but then I would miss looking at the latest blooming flowers. Like this thumbs sized purple flower blooming at the foot of a Burroak tree.](14_May_2021_07_50_53.jpg)



There are many things to see while walking the quarter mile Down the driveway to the chicken house to let the chickens out in the morning. It is easy to get in a rush and hurry through the chores, but while at all needs to get done, it's never so urgent that it needs to be done in a hurry. 



 

![One brown hen hearing through chicken wire. She is perched on a windowsill, and probably is there because she's successfully fought off the other 40 chickens so that she could have this crimes thought all to herself. More than 20 chickens crowd behind her in the shadowy chicken coop.](14_May_2021_07_56_41.jpg)

The whole is surrounded by unpainted, heavily weathered Gray planks of wood that look understandable extremely rough. The weathering has given them a silvery gray appearance](14_May_2021_07_59_04.jpg)



It takes about two minutes for all 40 chickens to squeeze them self one by one out of the chicken coop door and into the sunlight.  Often they come bursting out of the door at a run, like a grapeseed bursting out of the school used grape.  Given that there are 40 other chickens squeezing behind them pressuring them to get out of the way, it's no surprise they come out at a run. And they also race towards whatever kitchen scraps and garbage I have put out for them. 



 

![Although chickens love the grass and bugs and garbage, they also swarm the standard corn, oats, and feed mix I put out in the pans.  The feed is very nutritionally dense, which chickens that run around and are as active as this crew need in order to keep up their energy and lay their daily egg.](14_May_2021_08_04_56.jpg)



These chickens still like the regular food in addition to all the kitchen scraps, grass, bugs, worms, and other treats they get because they range freely outside. 



 

![A picture of 10 wall Montague nesting boxes. The nesting boxes are square 10 boxes that are a little over a square foot in volume, line with straw, and begin up for a single chicken to sit and lay her daily egg.  In this picture six out of 10 of the nesting boxes have a grumpy looking brown hen in them.](14_May_2021_08_10_16.jpg)
