<a href="https://youtu.be/2snxcdHQDDg"> notes from two engineers talking about ERMI a few years ago</a>
 

<code><pre>
Limited energy
So spend it well
Focus your efforts
Or get burn out hell

Understanding the problem
Broadly and deeply
Leads to solutions
Done well and done cheaply

Engineering with autism
Or Autisming Engineers.
Let's do a crossover
And turn some new gears

<pre>
I'm great at some things
I am awful at others
I've energy limits
And talking? Oh brother

How do use the strength to make ERMI better?

<pre>
I get hit by cars!
I burn down the kitchen.
That's just stuff that happens.
So designed for that mission!
Do not make me cook.
Don't make me cross roads.
Let me stick to research
And scripting the codes
</pre> 

<audio src="15_May_2021_10_13_16.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
So now I treat cooking
Just like it's a script
I make just one meal
Like it's code to be shipped
Pasta every day
Made exactly the same way
And hey?
Maybe I don't have to cook?
I could hire a person
To cook pasta. Look!

Once upon a Christmas time
The audit terror was coming
And then the lawyer saves the day
With excel programs running
He calls upon his coder friend
Two guys, this data plumbing
To reveal the fraud that was there by God
Instead of just succumbing

</pre>

Three epic days of hacking
To turn a million spreadsheet rows
To a simple one page sheet
Fraud is what this quick sheet shows.

<pre>
And the friends said this is epic
And the friend said this is great
And the friends said we will pay you
The sheet to go create

</pre> 

<audio src="15_May_2021_10_30_15.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
And the lawyer and the coder
Reluctantly became
A finance company
Because their sheet showed who to blame

<pre>
This tool we have created
It has saved peoples lives
And other scary stuff
That makes us break out in hives
If we think of it too deeply

No pressure, lalalala...
</pre> 

<audio src="15_May_2021_10_33_01.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
Because that's not why we do it
We find the problem interesting
That's all that there is to it
</pre> 

<audio src="15_May_2021_10_34_15.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
Our clients use our sheets
to find all kinds of interesting things
They pull a thread and go ahead
And see what that string brings

</pre>

Ode to the cars I have been run over by (in honor of Jamie)

<audio src="15_May_2021_10_36_18.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
My favorite cars are not really a stumper
I like the ones with squishy front bumpers
So that when I am hit it don't hurt quite as much
That's why plastic is better than metal and such
</pre> 

<audio src="15_May_2021_10_39_03.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

But wait, you might say, you expect to get hit?
Well, yes, based on my past I do expect it
Because yes, it has happened (more than once, by the way.
But how many times more than once I won't say)

But it does to lead to thoughts like the Audi is quite nice
If you simply must get run down
Go with Audi, my friend
The bruises are smaller, and, in the end

<pre>
I reflected my life so that now I don't go
Near the cards and the roads, and that just goes to show
It works best to respect what I canning can't do
And mixing with cars? Nah.  I'll leave that to you.

<pre>
Find the true cost of some thing
Find the energy spent
Find how hard it will be
And ignore the dissent
Of people who say
This can't be that hard
They don't know the road
And they disregard
That you have to test out
And find the true cost
To know where the gains are
And where energy’s lost
</pre> 

<audio src="15_May_2021_11_26_55.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
Find out what takes the longest
And find people for whom
That hard thing is easy
And then leave the room
And go to the things
You find easy. It's wise.
That is the way
To optimize.
</pre> 

<audio src="15_May_2021_11_29_09.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
And then go make the system
So easy and nice
To maintain all its parts
So no thinking twice
About if it is working
Or knowing it's "quirks”
It just does the thing
It just goes and works.

Our software takes a day of data
Conscious data for that day
Ignores all of the errata
And spits out what's not OK

<pre>
But I want it for a week!
OK, keep it simple, geek.

<audio src="15_May_2021_11_41_57.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
A week, you could say
Is five separate days
So run the code five times
One for each day
Line the days up, and, say! 
And you’ve got week. Tadah!
Anyways

</pre> 

<audio src="15_May_2021_11_43_00.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
There’s no reason to build
Some special code base
To handle a week
A weeks just a case
Five days
And a day I can already do
I just do it five times
The processing’s through
</pre> 

<audio src="15_May_2021_11_44_07.m4a" type="audio/mp4" controls> I’m sorry. You’re browser doesn’t support HTML5 <code>audio</code>. </audio>

<pre>
So we take it one day at a time
Breaking things down is sublime.
