```md
Limited energy
So spend it well
Focus your efforts
Or get burn out hell
```

Understanding the problem
Broadly and deeply
Leads to solutions
Done well and done cheaply
```

```md
Engineering with autism
Or Autisming Engineers.
Let's do a crossover
And turn some new gears

```

```md
I'm great at some things
I am awful at others
I've energy limits
And talking? Oh brother
```

```md
How do use the strength to make ERMI better?
```

```md
I get hit by cars!
I burn down the kitchen.
That's just stuff that happens.
So designed for that mission!
Do not make me cook.
Don't make me cross roads.
Let me stick to research
And scripting the codes
``` 

[audio](15_May_2021_10_13_16.m4a)

```md
So now I treat cooking
Just like it's a script
I make just one meal
Like it's code to be shipped
Pasta every day
Made exactly the same way
And hey?
Maybe I don't have to cook?
I could hire a person
To cook pasta. Look!

The origins of the ERMI: a charming Christmas tailed.
``` 

[audio](15_May_2021_10_17_57.m4a)

```md
Once upon a Christmas time
The audit terror was coming
And then the lawyer saves the day
With excel programs running
He calls upon his coder friend
Two guys, this data plumbing
To reveal the fraud that was there by God
Instead of just succumbing

```

```md
Three epic days of hacking
To turn a million spreadsheet rows
To a simple one page sheet
Fraud is what this quick sheet shows.
